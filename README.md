This is the Lyst source code!

Lyst is a game engine which is designed to support making games like those in the Myst series (I've only played the first three, and can't speak for the rest.) Not to be confused with Lyst, the Myst-like game based on the LASA high school.

This code is currently a bit of a mess. Perhaps over spring break I will fix it up a bit. Please, add features/bugfixes/etc.

There's a quick sample map in worlds/test. It might work. It sorta did for me.
